# To-Do List

-   make `serve restart` cleanly shutdown items and restart them
-   add args for each component 
    -   like --cargs="-m 10 -c 1024"
    -   "c" for memcached "args" for arguments
-   create "lnk" files? Maybe...
-   learn more python to be more efficient at it (hehe)


# Far Future List

-   Create a GUI file that will allow user to start server graphically
-   GUI to monitor if servers/daemons are running (red light/green light)
